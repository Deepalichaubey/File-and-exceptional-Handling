    "#Ques:-2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
    "#Ans:-A process pool is a collection of worker processes that are managed by a pool object, which handles the distribution of tasks to the workers. This concept is particularly useful in parallel computing, where you need to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Here’s how a process pool helps in managing multiple processes efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "##Key Benefits of Process Pools:\n",
    "#Resource Management:- By limiting the number of worker processes, a process pool helps manage system resources more effectively. This prevents the system from being overwhelmed by too many processes running simultaneously.\n",
    "#Task Distribution:- The pool object takes care of distributing tasks among the available worker processes. This ensures that all workers are utilized efficiently and tasks are completed as quickly as possible.\n",
    "#Simplified Code:- Using a process pool abstracts away much of the complexity involved in creating and managing multiple processes. This makes the code easier to write, read, and maintain.\n",
    "#Load Balancing:- The pool can dynamically allocate tasks to workers based on their availability, ensuring a balanced load across all processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Pool\n",

    "        results = pool.map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(results)\n",
    "\n",
    "##Explanation:\n",
    "#Creating the Pool:- Pool(3) creates a pool with 3 worker processes.\n",
    "#Mapping Tasks:- pool.map(square, numbers) distributes the square function across the worker processes, applying it to each element in the numbers list.\n",
    "#Collecting Results:- The results from each worker are collected and returned as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#When to Use Process Pools:\n",
    "#Batch Processing:- When you have a large number of independent tasks that can be processed in parallel, such as image processing or data transformation.\n",
    "#Parallel Computations:- For tasks that require significant computation and can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks.\n",
    "#I/O-bound Tasks:- Even though multithreading is often used for I/O-bound tasks, process pools can also be beneficial when the tasks involve both I/O and CPU-bound operations."
